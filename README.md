# The Roma People Project

The Roma Peoples Project is a start-up initiative at Columbia University that will address how Roma have represented themselves and how they have been represented by others. It will identify, centralize, examine, and curate images and information about the Roma people in order to bring them to the forefront of academic and public consciousness.

RPP uses a Jekyll version of the "Forty" theme by [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/).
